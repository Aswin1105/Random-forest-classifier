Random forest have increased accuracy than most of the supervised classification algorithm
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. 
It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning,
which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the 
average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset
